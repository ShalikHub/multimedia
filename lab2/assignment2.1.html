<ol>
	<li>Media type(screen)</li>
	<li>The actual query enclosed within parentheses, containing a particular media feature
        (max-device-width) to inspect, followed by target value.</li>
</ol><br>

<p>3):Why to use em(font) based sizing for examples margins?</p>
<p>In css, the em is a general unit of length related directly to font size. The fundamental advantage of using ems is that distances, lengths and spaces will all scale proportionately with the text sizes. When setting font-size in ems, we do so relative to the inherited font-size, that is to say font size of the element’s parent.</p><br>
